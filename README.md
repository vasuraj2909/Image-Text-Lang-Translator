# Image-to-Text Converter That Detects Language and Provides a Translated Summary


In today's digital age, language translation and text extraction from images have become
commonplace in many apps and software. However, our project goes beyond these
functionalities by offering an additional feature: text summarization in the user's desired
language. Many of us have encountered situations where we come across lengthy paragraphs
on websites or documents, and we simply need a brief summary to save time or accommodate
our busy schedules. With our platform, users can easily input text or upload an image of the
text in any language. They can then select their desired target language for translation and
also request a summary of the text's content, all with the assistance of cutting-edge NLP
(Natural Language Processing) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
Our process is designed to be step-by-step and user-friendly, allowing users to choose which
steps they want to skip. We provide a proper website with a sleek UI, powered by Flask
technology, to ensure a seamless and efficient experience. Whether it's translating text,
extracting text from images, or summarising content, our project offers a comprehensive
solution that caters to the diverse language needs of our users. Say goodbye to language
barriers and information overload - with our project, language translation and summarization
are made easy and accessible to all.
